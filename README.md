# arduino_valentines

## MATERIALS
(you can use different brands/models/etc this is just what I used)
many componants are found on aliexpress/alibaba/etc

arduino nano
-> Arduino nano every

oled screen
-> 0.91 inch OLED Module White/Blue

battery
-> 3.7v 650mah Lipo Polymer Battery

toggle switch
-> Toggle Switch ON-OFF-ON 3Pin

circuit board
-> I used a 5x7 board

jumper wires 
-> 3x jumper wires

cost: around $30 I had some of the companants already but if you need to buy everything 
(expect the soldering iron/solder) it would most likely be around $30-$40.

##TOOLS NEEDED
soldering iron + solder
-> alternatively you could use a breadboard for a more temporary project/for testing
(test before you solder!+ download code onto arduino before soldering+make sure it works!!)

STEP 1: Decide what you want displayed 
I did moon phases, a message and a heart gif.

STEP 2: Write code
I coded in C++ its a pretty basic program just using concepts of functions and arrays. 

STEP 3: Download onto arduino
Use arduino software, download it onto the nano.

STEP 4: solder headers onto arduino, solder arduino to board,
